"description":"A view can be small or big, and it can include other views. The template for a view can be stored in a file (<code>View</code>) or it can be provided as a string in your PHP code (<code>InlineView</code>, <code>StringView</code> and <code>FormatView</code> ).</p><p>The syntax for the templates used by <code>View</code> and <code>InlineView</code> is normal HTML and PHP. In general they should have a minimum of PHP code, mostly HTML and placeholders which can be coded as <code>&lt;?=$variable?&gt;</code> provided that <code>short_open_tag</code> is enabled in <code>php.ini</code> or in <code>.htaccess</code>. This is enabled by default in PHP 5.4 and later. For PHP 5.3 with disabled <code>short_open_tag</code> you must use full PHP tags:<br/><code>&lt;?php echo $variable; ?&gt;</code></p><p>The syntax for <code>StringView</code> is as for PHP double quoted strings, variables are without any tags, just a $ prefix. This class is also for inline short templates and it works regardless of <code>short_open_tag</code> settings.</p><p>The <code>FormatView</code> class use even simpler placeholders, it does not support PHP tags or variables, only string format specifiers like <code>%s</code>.</p><p>For more information and examples, check the view classes in the menu above."
