"description":"This is an abstract class, you can not make instances. You are adviced to make a subclass with a short name, like <code>UI</code> or similar, because the methods will be used extensively and a short name is faster to type. This also allows easy implementation of your own helper methods.</p><p>This class contains helper methods for easy implementation of most of the standard Bootstrap features, but you can of course combine it with plain Bootstrap style HTML.
